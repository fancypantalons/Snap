Snap v0.03
A Perl Napster Client
---------------------

Snap is an open source (licensed under the Artistic License), Perl-based
Napster client.  It's main goal is to remain relatively slim while providing
all the functionality demanded of a full-fledged Napster client.


Features
--------

Currently, Snap supports a wide range of features, including:

* Full song searching and library browsing support. 
* Regular expression filtering of search/browse results.
* Support for all upload and download methods, with upload speed throttling.
* Resume support (mostly... :)
* Download queuing (still rough, though :).
* Efficient MP3 data cache for fast logins.
* Chatting support, including multi-channel support.
* Support of most admin commands.
* Support for a subset of Opennap extensions.
* Hotlist support.
* Support for most other Napster commands, including ping, whois, etc.
* Support for alternate metaservers and Napster servers, for use 
  with OpenNap and other independant networks.
* Highly scriptable, including a builtin /eval function for evaluating
  Perl code on the fly from within the client. 
* Builtin help facility for all commands.
* Nice Curses interface with scroll-back buffer, colour capabilities,
  and GNU inputline-style input.
* Additionally, an optional GTK GUI interface.
* Small set of standard IRC commands, such as /exec.


Supported Platforms
-------------------

Snap has been known to work on the following platforms, however I'm sure that
as long as you have a working Perl5 installation, it should work (although
perhaps not perfectly ;).

* Redhat Linux 5.2 (i686)
* RedHat Linux 6.0 (i686)
* OpenBSD 2.5
* FreeBSD 4.0 (thanks to Ed Heil)
* Digital Unix 4.0 (thanks to Hugo Leote)
+ SunOS

All platforms use Perl 5, which is required (at least AFAIK) for Snap
to run.  As well, you need a working version of basic POSIX IPC (fork(),
signals, pipes, etc)... meaning no Win32... :(

+ There is limited support for SunOS, however, there are known issues with 
  the Curses interface (ie, it doesn't work properly :) that seems to be a
  result of a broken Curses implementation on that platform.  However, the
  plain text and GUI interfaces should work.


Software Requirements
---------------------

In terms of required software, Snap only needs a working Perl 5 installation.
However, snap can take advantage of various additional modules, if they are
available.  The presence of these modules causes the inclusion of various
additional features.  The following is a list of the modules Snap can take
advantage of, and the features which are enabled when they are present.

* Time::HiRes - Upload speed throttling.
* Curses      - Full-screen TUI interface.
* MD5         - Correct MP3 MD5 signatures.
# Gtk         - GTK GUI Module requires this (this must be loaded explicitly).

Lack of these modules will result in the following modified behaviours:

* Time::HiRes - Upload speed throttling settings will be ignored.
* Curses      - Ugly plaintext interface will be used. :)
* MD5         - A dummy MD5 signature like OpenNap's will be used (all 0's).
* Gtk         - Fallback to whatever TUI is available.


Installing Snap
---------------

First of all, it's possible to run Snap straight from the directory
created by the tarball.  However, if this is to be a system-wide
installation, simply run the install.sh script.  This will install
Snap into the following directories:

snap    -> /usr/local/bin/snap
libsnap -> /usr/local/lib/libsnap
snaprc  -> /usr/local/share/snap/snaprc
scripts -> /usr/local/share/snap/scripts

You can edit the install script if you wish to install Snap into a 
different location, however Snap assumes your system obeys Unix path
conventions (ie, bin/, lib/, share/ in one common directory).

Once the script is run, a user can run the snap.inst script (again,
you can change this name if you like) to install the snaprc file and
to populate the basic snap directory.


Running Snap
------------

Well, there isn't a lot to it.  To get help with parameters, type:

  snap -h

This will display a help screen with all the command-line parameters
available.

When Snap is running, you can get access to the online help through the "/help"
command.  Use this command to get a list of the commands and their operation.

    /admin            - Execute Napster Admin command
