Snap v0.02a
A Perl Napster Client
---------------------

Snap is an open source, Perl, text-based Napster client written using
the ncurses library for screen control.  It's main goal is to remain
relatively slim while providing all the functionality demanded of a
full-fledged Napster client.  It has been tested on the following
platforms, although I'm sure many more will work without difficulty:

* Redhat Linux 5.2 (i686)
* RedHat Linux 6.0 (i686)
* OpenBSD 2.5

All platforms use Perl 5, which is required (at least AFAIK) for Snap
to run.

Snap currently requires the following Perl modules to run:

* Time::HiRes - For download/upload throttling.
* Curses      - For screen control.
* MD5         - For calculating MP3 MD5 signatures.

Note:  It is quite possible to install these modules into a user home
directory, allowing users to run Snap without needing admin access.
See the section on Snap and Perl Modules for more information.

Currently, Snap supports a wide range of features, including:

* Full song searching and library browsing support. 
* Regular expression filtering of search/browse results.
* Multiple simultaneous upload and download support including upload speed
  throttling.
* Resume support (mostly... :)
* Chatting support, including multi-channel support.
* Support of all admin commands, including Opennap extensions.
* Hotlist support.
* Support for most other Napster commands, including ping, whois,
  etc.
* Support for alternate metaservers and Napster servers, for use 
  with Opennap.
* Highly scriptable, including a builtin /eval function for evaluating
  Perl code on the fly.
* Builtin help facilities for all commands.

Of course, this is an early release, so much of the code is rough, but
it's getting there. :)

Installing Snap
---------------

Well, first, you need to install the Time::HiRes, Curses, and MD5 modules.  
I would take a look at CPAN for these.  Once you've done this, you'll have
to modify the first line of the snap file to point to your Perl binary,
and change the -I flag to point to your snap directory. You'll want to
change the directory to be a full path name if you want to run snap from a
directory other than it's home directory.

After all this is done, copy the snaprc file to ~/.snaprc.

As well, if you wish to install Snap in a system-wide directory, try doing
the following:

Create /usr/local/share/snap
Copy the MPEG directory and nbsocket.pm to /usr/local/share/snap
Edit the first line of snap:

  #!/usr/bin/perl -I./

to

  #!/usr/bin/perl -I/usr/local/share/snap

That should do it! If you have any troubles, make sure the permissions
on all the files/directories are correct (755 for snap and MPEG, 644 for 
nbsocket and the contents of the MPEG directory). :)

Snap and Perl Modules
---------------------
If you don't have admin access to your system, it may be necessary to
install the required Perl modules to run snap in your home directory.
In order to do this, you'll need to get the packages from CPAN.  Then,
copy the following files into the Snap distribution directory:

Curses.pm -> snapdir/
MD5.pm -> snapdir/
Time/HiRes.pm -> snapdir/Time/
Curses.bs,Curses.so -> snapdir/auto/Curses/
MD5.bs,MD5.so,autosplit.ix -> snapdir/auto/MD5/
HiRes.bs,HiRes.so -> snapdir/auto/Time/HiRes/

This should be all that is necessary to install Snap into a home 
directory.
